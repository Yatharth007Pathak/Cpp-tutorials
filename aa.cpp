C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the 1980s. 
It is an extension of the C programming language with additional features such as object-oriented programming (OOP) 
and generic programming capabilities.

/*
break down the code step by step:

#include <iostream>
This line includes the iostream header file, which allows input and output operations to be performed in the program. 
In this code, it's used to enable the usage of standard input-output streams like std::cout.

int main() {
This line defines the main function, which is the entry point of the program. Execution of the program starts from here.

std::cout << "Om Namo Narayan";
This line uses std::cout to output the text "Om Namo Narayan" to the standard output (usually the console).

return 0;
This line indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns a status code of 0 to the operating system.
This conventionally means that the program terminated without any errors.

}
This curly brace closes the main function.

In summary, this program simply prints "Om Namo Narayan" to the console and then terminates with a status code of 0.
