/*
int x, y;
This line declares two integer variables named x and y without initializing them.

x = 7;
y = 8;
These lines assign the values 7 and 8 to the variables x and y, respectively.

cout << x << endl;
This line prints the value of the variable x to the standard output stream, followed by a newline character. 
The value of x (which is 7) will be printed on a new line.

cout << "y";
This line outputs the string "y" to the standard output stream. 
Note that the string "y" is enclosed in double quotes, so it will be treated as a string literal and printed as-is.
